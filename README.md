The design and construction of this system belongs to me. This example doesn't work very well and doesn't reflect the strengths of the system because I used singleton to keep the project simple.There is no pool system. But in short
It is good that the Cell-> BaseNode structure and the fact that it is easy to find locations and nodes thanks to this structure.

This structure is a bit procedural, but I have used it in many of my projects and it easily evolves into the structure you want.
This repo is not for use but to show my mindset, but I will turn this repo into a nice grid system asset as soon as possible.
